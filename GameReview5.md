Also, published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Far Cry 5 is the inheritor of the 2014 video game Far Cry 4, and the fifth main installment in the Far Cry series. Far Cry 5  was released on March 27, 2018. Far Cry 5 was heavily inspired by several socio-political events in modern history, such as the Cold War and the September 11 attacks. Far Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter set in an open world environment which the player can explore freely on foot, via various vehicles, and fast travel. Unlike previous titles in the series where the player takes on the role of a set character, the game gives the player the opportunity to customize their character's appearance. The player has a variety of ranged and explosive weapons to fight against enemies, with the game placing a renewed emphasis on close-quarters combat compared to the previous Far Cry titles by introducing a wider range of melee weapons. In addition, Far Cry 5 features a new weapons ballistics system that includes elements like a bullet dropping over a distance to make it more realistic.
