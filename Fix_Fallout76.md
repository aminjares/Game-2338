(Xbox One) Salvaged assaultron head used up all 1300 rounds in one shot. First time equipping it, wanted to see how it worked, apparently not well :) Based off the description of how its supposed to work versus what I did to cause this issue, I did not attempt to reload it before firing, I equipped it (for the first time ever), and then fired. And I didnt even get to hit an enemy!

(Xbox One) "Connection failed: Timed out while waiting for server to respond." Is the error I'm faced with more often than not when trying to play with my wife on FO76. I am on a One X her a One S we are on the same network, both hard wired to the router, open NAT types, 175mbps dl, 8mbps ul. Tried to support a ticket they just sent me some basic trouble shooting techniques, they did not work. Then randomly some days we get lucky enough and we can play together, have no idea why sometimes it works fine and other times it is impossible. Even had one day were we started out the day playing together, then after a crash on my end we could not connect to each other for the rest of the day.

Issue: Camo paint only applies to base armour (PC) 
Description: The camouflage for combat armour bought in the atomic shop will only apply to the standard version of combat armor. If it is modded with polymer or shadowed for example, it will show the paint for those, not the camo paint.

(PS4) Also having constant issues with inviting friends and joining them. Invites are unavailable when friends are right in front of me, and hitting "Join" seldom works
