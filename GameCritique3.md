### Game Title: Hitman 2 (PS4) 

Hitman 2 is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Warner Bros. Hitman 2 was released on November 13, 2018 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the seventh entry in the Hitman video game series and is the sequel to the 2016 game Hitman. In hitman 2 the plays as the hitman named Agent 47. Agent 47 was born on September 5, 1964, in a Romanian asylum with a number tattooed on the back of his head in the form of a barcode. After playing hitman 2 on Playstation 4 and already have experienced The hitman before, I spotted some functions I think a tester would look at.

One function a tester would catch quickly is the player movement. To make Agent 47 run the user must hold down the game control L1 and move the analog stick in the desired direction. When performing this function Agent 47 stops after turning left or right sometimes. To continue running the user has to let go game control L1 and hold down L1 again. The correct requirment is the function should have Agent 47 run continuously in the user's desired direction without stopping from holding down game control L1 and moving the analog stick left or right until the user lets go of game control L1. Another function a tester would look at is throwing objects at enemies that are on the other side of a wall. To have Agent 47 throw an object at an enemy the user must hold down the game control L2 and aim at the enemy until a orange ring appears on the enemies head. Then, the user must press game control R2 to have Agent 47 throw the object at the enemy. While performing this function with an enemy passing by a door the object Agent 47 throws hits the enemy regardless if the enemy makes it pass the door as long as the object is thrown before the orange ring disappears. The object will go straight through the wall every time when Agent 47 has an enemy locked with the orange ring. I would think this isn't the correct function requirement because to make hitman 2 a more realistic concept the correct function requirement would be for the object to hit the wall. Thus, if the wall gets in the way of an enemy even if Agent 47 has the enemy locked with the orange ring.     

These are just a few of the initial functions a tester would need to look at when evaluating Hitman 2 on the Playstation 4.
