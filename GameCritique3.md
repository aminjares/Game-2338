### Game Title: Hitman 2 

(Give title of game, type of game and game designer/maker) 

(Name 3-5 aspects of the game you think should be tested and why?)

Example: 

The tennis game on Wii Sports is a very fun and easy game to play. The maker of Wii sports is Nintendo and there are several other sports that can be played on the Wii Sports game disc. After playing the tennis game on Wii Sports, there are several functions I think a tester would look at.

One function that would be looked at immediately is the player mode/selection. A total of four players can play a tennis match; this can be done with 1 Wii remote or multiple Wii remotes. Another important function that might be tested is the player movement, making sure the direction you are moving is in line with the game.  Scoring would be another major function that should be tested, if a player hits the ball out of bound or hits the net, making sure a proper out occurs and the scoring is incremented correctly.

These are just a few of the initial functions that would a tester would need to look at when evaluating the Wii Sports tennis game.
