## Game Review 2

### Game Title: Respawn
By: Kay_Lynn, DBorsheim, djcarpenter

### Summary
Respawn is a action 2-D puzzle, unity, and platformer where the player has to die to win by firguring out the puzzle of the game. The player carries a triangular object to throw across where the player wants to respawn. For insistance, in the beginning of the game the player starts off on top of a building with the triangular object to aim and land on top of the building the player is trying to get across. Then the player must die to respawn where the triangular object landed and repeat to get through the game.     

### Final thoughts
Respawn was fun playing by dying to win the idea is kind of funny because I usually avoid dying in these types of game. As soon as I had figured out the key objective, dying to win, I was able to get through the game. I guess, the name of the game "Respawn" gives it away. After playing Respawn I scanned through the comments to see what others thought of their experience playing Respawn. In one comment the player "or321", requested to add checkpoints while playing the boss level or at least one checkpoint. Another player "Pappsy1" taught the game was repetitive similar to what I thought. Some online PC games I've experienced that was to difficult I would take it as the game had not been functioning correctly and move on to another game. If a game is too difficult it should have either checkpoints or multiple difficulty levels. Overall respawn was a cool game and idea even without checkpoints due to I've always liked to play all my games on the highest difficulty level.
