## Game Review 2

## Game Title: Thieves Assassin

## Summary
Thieves Assassin is a cool adventure platform game for desktop browser and moblie browser. The character is dressed as a somewhat knight that carries a sword, bombs that can be shot, and can preform a special ice or fire blast attack. Thieves Assassin has three playable worlds with 12 unlockable levels in each world to complete the game. Also, there are three heros to pick from that can jump through obstacles in each level. Throughout the game lies enemies to kill, gold coins to collect for points, and blocks to break for jewels. In addition the player can collect gold coins to use for more ammo for the bombs and special attacks. Thieves Assassin is built with HTML5 to run without delays in most browsers.
## Final thoughts
The whole idea of a hero dressed as a knight that slays the enemies with a sword, blows the enemy up with bombs, and can do special attacks really caught my attention. Before I knew it I had already ran through the first world which is 12 levels I completed. While playing Thieves Assassin I learned some cool perks about the game such as jumping on certain walls can get the player stuck to help the player get around low or high places. I thought the graphics were really good and the game ran awesome without any pausing or freezing. After experiencing the first world I want to complete the other two worlds to finish the full game. Since Thieves Assassin was released in 2017 and it's 2018 now I wonder if they will come out with part 2.
