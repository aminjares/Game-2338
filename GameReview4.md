## Summary
Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is a very casual platform video game compilation. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is remasters of the first three titles in the Crash Bandicoot series: Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes Back, and Warped. The game was released to playstation in June 2017 and first published by Naughty Dog all from 1996-1998. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide by the end of September 2017. In addition, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy was released for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in June 2018. The idea is to get Crash Bandicoot through each level to stop Doctor Neo Cortex from taking over the world. 

## Final thoughts
I remember when I played the first Crash Bandicoot on Playstation, the game was really casual and easy to play. Although, being younger at the time to complete the game all I had to remember was a few techniques. First, is how to move Crash Bandicoot around the gameplay area. Second, use the button "square" for Crash to preform a spinning move. Third, use the "X" button to make Crash jump when needed. Last, combing all three techniques can have Crash Bandicoot jumping over gaps and jumping while performing the spinning move. Crash uses his moves to defeat enemies, smash crates, and collect items such as Wumpa Fruits, extra lives, and Aku Aku masks. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy provides way better features into to the game producing much better quality in graphics. In the sequel Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, Crash is introduced to the "O" button in which crash can now crawl, jump in the air followed by a body slam to the ground, and run to slide crash across the ground. In this version the player must get all 25 crystals from the levels to get Crash to Doctor Neo Cortex. It was cool to bring Doctor Cortex back and to get to use Crash Bandicoot's new techniques. Even better, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy added new features across all three games, including checkpoints and the pause menus. Also, save systems that include both manual saving, automatic saving, and time trials that were brought first to Crash Bandicoot Wrapped. Crash Bandicoot Wrapped is the third version in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy in which I like how the game introduces the new villain evil entity named Uka Uka (Aku Aku's evil younger twin brother) to join Doctor Cortex to take over the world. I brought the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy because I remembered how fun and easy the game was to play.
