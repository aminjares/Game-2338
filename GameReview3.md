## Final thoughts
The Metal Gear Solid Series is my all time farvorite stealth action-adventure game. The Phantom Pain played the best out of the Metal Gear Series becuase of the long story mode, graphics, and has free roam. I like that the player can freely roam and sneek up on the enemies one by one without being seen. Also, I use the silencer weapons on the enemies then go and hide the bodys to leave no trace even though the game probably in encourages the player to progress through the game without killing. A new cool feature is players get to ride around the game world in jeeps, tanks, motorcycles, and on horseback. In addition, players can call helicopter support to request airstrikes on the enemies and use rock climbing for shortcuts around the map. It is very cool The Phantom Pain allows the player to travel the game world or deploy directly to landing zones that give the player different options of approach. The game play design allows the player to choose in what order the story events take place by selecting missions in any order the player desires. The player can use snake's binoculars to mark enemies to alwyas know their location. I like how snake can sneek up to use non-lethal weapons like the tranquilizer darts or subdue enemies. Last, but not least, it super cool how the player can cycle from day to night by lighting snake's phantom cigar to analyze the movement of marked enemys in the area, such as shifts in sentry patrols and individual patrol routes.
