### Game Testing Concepts
1. After watching some the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?

    One important skill for a tester to have is manuel testing for visual verification where somebody has to watch the player to see if the game as intended. Also, a couple other important skills are single-player testing and multiplayer testing. The difference between the two is multiplayer testing is a bunch of variables happening such as having more than fifteen concolse in the same game running on different networks. 

2. What do you think is hardest about being a tester based watching the video? 

    The diffcult process of deciding what bugs the tester wants to fix called "Triage" when closing a game. Triage is when the tester tackles one bug and happens to create many more bugs.  

3. What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?

    I learned Mircosoft has a group of people devoted to doing user research. This is called usability testing by running one participant at a time for the psychology PhDs research team to get into the player head. Also, play testing is where the research team get a goup of participants to play the game and if there is over 80% of them with issues they know something wrong with the game.
