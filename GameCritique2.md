### Game Title: Grand Theft Auto V (Online)
Grand Theft Auto V is both an action and adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. The  game was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. In November 2014 the game was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and in April 2015 for Microsoft Windows.

Today, I will explain some aspects that I would like to test from playing Grand Theft Auto V on the Playstation 4. Grand Theft Auto V is one of my top favorite games but there're some things I would like to update. First off is while playing online players can glitch in and out of places that they arent suppose to be. These places are in buildings that are not meant to be in so, while the player is inside other players can't damage that player glitching. The player glitching can actually see the other players outside the building and damage them as if the building was sort of see through. In the game there is not just one glitch-able building but many others. One glitch I know that still hasn't been patched by an update is on top of one the highest buildings there is a wall that the player can fall inside and start to air dive down while inside the building. Now the trick is to land at the bottom without parachuting outside the building because once glitched inside the building the walls are basically invisible. Players use this glitch to complete bountys they have on them or get away from other players since some other players don't know this glitch. Second, the tank, when I started playing Grand Theft Auto V there was only one tank and inside this tank can only hold one player. I always wanted an updated where 2-3 players can fit in the tank with controlled weapons available or even add another tank with those options. Surprisingly, last year they added new tanks with those options which made the game more fun to me. The tank held 4 players aand was equipped with a machine gun, land mines, and rockets. The first tank was slow and couldn't be customized. The new tanks are alot faster and can be customized. Customizing the new tanks allows the player to add color, personal logo graphics, and weapons. 

Third, I would test breaking down certain fences that is wrapped around the landing field at the airport. When players leave the airport in a plane sometimes others players try to shoot them down so the player parachutes into the ocean next to the landing field. Now the player has to swim to shore and once arrived there is what I call the "Invincible Fence" because the fence can't even be blown up with a RPG rocket launcher. The player has to run all the way around or kill them self just to get on the other side of the fence. Even then sometimes killing yourself won't get the player on the other side of the fence. Another aspect I would test is selling as many of the players owed cars with no wait time. Before, players would have to wait a certain amount of time after selling one of their owed cars to sell another one. The test would be fair to sell as many owed cars at any given time since they are already owed. Now the ones that the players steal from the CPU that drive around the map is reasonable for those to keep the wait time so players won't just steal and sell cars all day. 

The idea for updating these test is so the players will have more fun playing Grand Theft Auto V online and so the online gameplay works as attended.
