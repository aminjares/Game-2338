### Game Title: NBA 2K19
NBA 2K19 is a basketball simulation video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports. NBA 2k19 is the 20th installment in the NBA 2K franchise and way better game compared to NBA 2K18. NBA 2K19 was announced early in June 2018 and was released on September 11, 2018. People who had pre-ordered the 20th Anniversary Edition of the game received it 4 days early with NBA rookie of the year Ben Simmons of the Philadephia 76ers on the cover of the Standard Edition. Also, those who wanted the 20th Anniversary Edition had LeBron James of the Los Angeles lakers on the cover and with more downloadable content than the Standard Edition. The soundtrack for NBA 2K19, was organized by rapper Travis Scott and includes three of his own songs.

Today, I'll like to bring to attention some conditions from NBA 2K19 and what parts I feel should be tested for better performance during gameplay. First off, in career mode of team practice, the player is given four drills to updrade each badge that represents the created players attributes of perfomance in the game. In each drill the max a player can get is 3-Star which only give 700 points closer to unlocking a badge or the next stage to a badge. To get a 3-Star (700 points) the player has to really try or be used to the shooting. The lowest score a player can get is 1-Star that gives 100 points towards a badge. If the player scores a 2-Star the player gets 400 points towards a badge. Based on my created player, I get five primary badges and 16 secondary badges and all badges start at (0/5000 points). Some badges get completed when the player hits the 5000 points mark that awards the bronze badge but, the other badges upgrade to sliver (15,000 points), gold (40,000 points) or higher not inculding the points earned to get the pervious badges. After acknowledging how many points is given for each drill and how many points it takes to upgrade a badget is a little steep to me. My opinion, if NBA 2k19 patched an update adding a 4-Star rating for the drills that gives 1300 points and add a 5-Star rating that give 1800 points the players will have more of an advantage towrds upgrading badges since the points required is high. Secondly, while park the player can go to the stores like the NBA store, footlocker, and the SWAG's store where a player can buy glasses with VC in game currency.
